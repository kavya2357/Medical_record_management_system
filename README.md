# Blockchain-based Marksheet System
Welcome to the Blockchain-based Marksheet System! This system is built using React.js, SmartPy, Temple Wallet, and Tezos blockchain. It provides a secure and decentralized solution for storing and verifying academic marksheets. 
Introduction
The Blockchain-based Marksheet System is a decentralized application (DApp) that utilizes blockchain technology to store and verify academic marksheets. This project is built using React.js as the frontend framework, SmartPy as the smart contract development platform, Temple Wallet as the Tezos wallet, and Tezos blockchain for storing marksheets.

Traditional marksheet systems often suffer from issues such as data manipulation, unauthorized changes, and lack of transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures the immutability, transparency, and security of marksheets. The use of SmartPy and Temple Wallet in combination with Tezos blockchain provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing marksheets.
## Tech Stack

Node.js (version 12 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)
SmartPy CLI
Temple Wallet browser extension (for interacting with the Tezos blockchain)
## Usage
Connect Temple Wallet to your Tezos network:

Open the Temple Wallet browser extension.
Create a new wallet or import an existing one.
Connect Temple Wallet to your desired Tezos network (e.g., local sandbox or testnet).
Access the application:

Navigate to project folder and run npm start to access the react application
